\section{Introduction}
This project implements a fully functional JavaFX Application to display historical Air Pollution Data of the whole United Kingdom on an interactive map. Users will be able to explore the historic pollution levels between 2018 and 2023 on a colour coded map as well as view detailed location and pollution data at specific data points. There are many quality of life features implemented such as a robust GUI to filter through different years and pollutants, as well as a “colourblind mode” to make the pollution viewer more accessible. 

This project fulfils all base requirements and extends functionality greatly by implementing features such as Live Air Quality API integration and a highly detailed statistical analysis tool. The challenge extensions are listed in greater detail in the report. 

Additionally, this project takes great care and consideration for high cohesion and low coupling, making most classes modular and following the Model View Controller design pattern to fully separate UI functionalities from the logic of the program.

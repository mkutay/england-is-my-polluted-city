\section{Unit Testing}
Unit testing was implemented with JUnit for various classes and public methods in those classes to test the \textit{interface} of those classes. The tests ensure that the methods are working as expected and use different forms of input ranging from valid to invalid. For example, for querying location data, we tested valid coordinates within London to ensure a successful query, and then tested invalid coordinates to ensure correct error handling. Tests were also created on all the statistics calculators to ensure that they give out correct information. This was done by calculating statistical values differently to how they are in the calculators. Overall, these tests were vital in adding functionality to the codebase, as they allowed us to ensure that the new functionality did not break any existing functionality.

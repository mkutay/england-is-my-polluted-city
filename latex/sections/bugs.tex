\section{Bugs and Issues}

    - Loading Pollution Statistics for the first time before caching will take a few seconds, causing some lag. All subsequent loading of the page will be instant.
    
    - When zooming in and out of the map view quickly, due to the loading of the LODs, the map stops for a couple moments. (speed of API call issue)
    
    - Most issues were identified and fixed thanks to rigorous testing, as mentioned above.

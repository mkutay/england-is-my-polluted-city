## On commit messages

- Be as descriptive as possible
- Create your commits like your Java classes: cohesive. When you change some *functionality*, commit to the repo.
- Commits should only serve one purpose.
- [Some conventions for commit messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716).
